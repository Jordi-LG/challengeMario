## About the app

The challenge was normally to work with the PHP class.  
In my learning with vueJS, I decided to make an app to illutrate all this PHP challenge and expected functions

## Usage

When the website is launched, you can choose your character.  
You can hit him or give him an extra-life.  
Also give him a mushroom to see your character growth. If you hit him, he'll shrink.  
Finally, give him a star and he'll become invincible !

Refresh to choose an another character.
